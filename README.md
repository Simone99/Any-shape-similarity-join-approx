The code is an implementation of the triangle similarity join with grid method explained in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01818) paper.<br>
The tree data structure used is an AVL tree whose original code can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree).<br>
The input parser code has been rearranged from the [original](https://stackoverflow.com/a/868894).<br>
